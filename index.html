      <h2>Erasmus Project-Yes Europe III</h2>
      <div class="er-con">

              <p>
              In the 4th year,while I was attending high school in my town I took part an Erasmus+ projects. The mobility took part in Germany where I stayed 3 months.It was an experience I couldn`t describe,it was wonderful to see what other students at my age go through,their education system etc.
                  The project name was Yes Europe III. It was a collaboration between our country,Belgium,Bulgaria and Germany.
              </p>

                  The project YES Europe III - Young people in Education and Studies working in Europe successfully aimed at helping students to find study and work options in Europe.
                  In the Europe today more and more  young people know that they will be unemployed after finishing their schooling and therefore lack motivation to continue with their education and even drop out of school.  There are young people needed in many work fields all over Europe. However the students do not know how they can find a job outside their home country. They also do not know how to find study options which will enable them to work in a different European country.  During the project students  gained the necessary intercultural, methodical, linguistic and ICT competences to enable them to find work and study options in the European partner countries.
